  Description of Artifact Three: The third artifact that I chose for my ePortfolio is the same as artifact two. This project is from CS340: Advanced Programming Concepts. Written in Jupyter Notebook using MongoDB, Python, and Pymongo. I chose this artifact to create a MongoDB interface with HTML/JavaScript by taking the partial HTML that is used in this project and turning it into a full web page. I used Visual Studio Code to create the web page using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. 

  While enhancing this project I quickly learned how different coding a web page with Jupyter Notebook and MongoDB is compared to coding a web page with HTML and JavaScript. Jupyter Notebook allowed me to incorporate the Mongo Database by importing the data internally and calling on the queries using the Python CRUD file. Doing this same process in Visual Studio Code was not successful as there are different ways to import the data to the web page. Starting on a blank coding project, I wrote the HTML code to create the outline of the web page that I desired. I have the Grazioso Salvare Logo centered at the top of the web page along with the title of the web page. I created a navigation bar to navigate to different pages on the site and originally this was going to be just for design, but I decided to make it fully functional by adding a Pie Charts page and an About page. The Pie Charts page contains the information about the different training categories and the desired breeds for each category along with the pie chart that shows how many desired breeds are in the database under the specified categories. The About page contains the information from the ReadMe file for the original project and a link to the GitHub repository that project sits in which allows the viewer to access the source code.

  One of the many challenges I faced in this project was importing a .CSV file that contained the data from the Mongo Database and calling on that data to fill an interactive table or pie chart using HTML or JavaScript. I learned how to import the .CSV file containing the data and how to create an HTML table based on the data. I added interactivity to the HTML table by changing the CSS design of the table to make the table look nice and added the function that the user can highlight parts of the table my hovering their mouse cursor over the table. The HTML table contains only 99 entries from the 10,000 entries that are in the Mongo Database to reduce loading time for the table. To make the HTML table a set size, I added the function that allows the table to scroll along the x-axis and the y-axis. This allows the table to show 10 files in the beginning and the user can scroll down further to reach file 99. I also learned how to make the navigation bar for each page interactive, where the user can hover their mouse cursor over a tab in the navigation bar and the tab will change color based on where the mouse cursor is hovering. I added the function that the active page the user is on will stay the highlighted color to show the user where they are on the web site. 

  This artifact showcases my knowledge in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. It demonstrates that I can take the information from a full-stack web site and use a different coding language to create a similar web site that contains the same data and a different layout.
