  Description of Artifact One: The first artifact that I chose for my ePortfolio is a project that contains a rendering of a 3D model. This project is from CS330: Computational Graphics & Visualization. Written in Visual Studio Community using C++ OpenGL, this project was not fully completed when I finished this course. During the course I had difficulty adding more than one 3D rendering to the project and it was left incomplete but still showed the milestones for each category the project required me to show. I chose this artifact because it shows how far I have come with C++ OpenGL by adding more 3D renders to the project to show a complete table with objects on it instead of a table with one object on it.
  
  Enhancing this artifact shows that I can create fully functional 3D renderings by using nothing but code instead of using a pre-built program such as Blender. This artifact demonstrates the mathematical knowledge I have gained over my years as a student at SNHU by plotting the points to create a 3D model instead of a simple 2D model. This artifact also demonstrates my knowledge with the C++ OpenGL coding language and my knowledge of using the Visual Studio Community coding environment.
  
  During the enhancement process, I learned that planning out an idea for a project is the easiest part of coding and that the hard part is taking that idea and making it a reality. I learned how to add multiple 3D models to a single project and how to map these models on a 3D graph to align them the way I want them to show up in the render. The 3D models in this project were created using vertices of triangles. To make a Notebook, I had to map out the triangles correctly to align them together and create a rectangle for the face of the object. To turn this object into a 3D object, I then had to map the triangles to form the sides and bottom of the Notebook. This was done by graphing the points for the first triangle, flipping those points mathematically to connect the triangles together and then taking those points and adding a different depth to them to form the view of a 3D model. The same process was used when creating the Lamps base and neck. I ran into the challenge of flipping the points correctly to have the triangles render on the correct axis of the 3D graph to connect the triangles together and form the model. To fix this, I used graphing paper to create a 3D graph where I can plot each point and visualize my desired outcome before coding the points in the project itself. This helped me visualize my design and solve the graphing errors.
  
  This artifact was enhanced by adding two 3D models to fill the empty space of the table. This was done by coding in a Notebook and a Lamp that contains the lamps base and the lamps neck without having the objects overlapping. The objects that did overlap were the base and neck of the lamp to connect the rendered items together to form the Lamp as a whole.
