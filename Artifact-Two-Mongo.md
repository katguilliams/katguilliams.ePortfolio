  Description of Artifact Two: The second artifact that I chose for my ePortfolio is a project that contains a CRUD. This project is from CS340: Advanced Programming Concepts. Written in Jupyter Notebook using MongoDB, Python, and Pymongo. I chose this artifact to show my knowledge of using NoSQL databases and the Python coding language.

  This project uses a Python CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) file that connects to a Mongo Database and allows the specified data in the database to be sorted. This project showcases the file working with a set of data that is used to find and identify dogs for training in different fields to be able to find and help in the rescue of humans or other animals. The data is sorted into an interactive table that can be sorted by the training field of the service which will pull up the desired breeds for that field and the locations of the dogs who fit the criteria for that field. This project allows the search to be ran under specific parameters that the company requires as there are specific parameters that the dogs must fit to be able to go through the training such as being a specific breed or a specific age range. Using this project makes finding these animals easier as it lists out the animals that match the parameters in a data table that is interactive based on the training type.

  Enhancing this artifact shows the progress I have made with using Jupyter Notebook as a coding environment to create a full-stack web page that pulls data using a Python CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) file that I developed. The Python CRUD file allows the data uploaded to a Mongo Database to be sorted automatically based on certain parameters. This is done by importing the Python CRUD file into a desired project, altering the file to fit the MongoDB host requirements, and declaring the database that the file will be used with. I enhanced this artifact by correcting the radio buttons for the training services to be clickable and then I added some visual design changes to the text of the radio buttons to enlarge the text and change the color of the text to fit the colors of each training type. For example: the Water Rescue radio buttons text is enlarged and changed to blue to categorize the training as Water Rescue.

  Enhancements made to this artifact showcase that I can enhance algorithms search criteria and full-stack web functionality. I updated the Python CRUD file to include a Read All criteria that makes searching through the database easier as it allows all the files to be read. This project has a database of 10,000 files so the process takes a moment to load the query outcomes. I corrected the code for the radio buttons as there was a mistake in the spelling for Disaster Rescue or Individual Training that made the radio button unusable as the value that was being called was DIT and not DRIT. I then changed the pie chart visualization to include a title and to categorize the data by breed. I did run into the issue that my computer was running slow with Jupyter Notebook, and it kept timing out the outputs of the project which made checking the enhancements progress difficult. Without being able to see the output immediately after running the terminal, it made it difficult to make multiple changes at a time. To solve this issue, I broke the project into different cells where the main data was called on in the first few cells and the final cell printed the output. This did not solve the problem completely, but it allowed Jupyter Notebook to show the outputs faster which allowed me to see and correct any errors in a timely manner.
