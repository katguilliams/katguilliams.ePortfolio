## Professional Self-Assessment

  I have been in the Computer Science program for a total of four years. During my time as a Computer Science major, I have learned how to write and develop programs using various coding languages such as C++, Python, and Java. Throughout the Computer Science program, I have coded several projects that showcase my knowledge of these different coding languages.
My future career consists of me knowing how to develop a program using various coding languages. This is important because I want to become a software developer and the main task for a software developer is to collaborate with a team of developers to create and maintain a coding project. To do this, I need to be able to understand different coding languages that are used in the project and the coding environments that are used in the project as well. My career plan is to get into an entry-level position for a Tech company that will utilize my coding experience and help me further my knowledge with firsthand experience. I would like to start from the bottom and work my way up the company.

  My specialization is with computers in general but if I had to be more specific it would be programming with C++, Java, and Python as a back-end developer.
  
  While working through the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University, I have learned and improved coding skills, abilities, and knowledge. I have improved my attention to detail with coding projects that allows me to debug projects in a timely manner by being cautious in the development process and continuously testing the changes made to the project to prevent there being a long list of errors at the end of the project. Testing the code as you work through a project is crucial to ensure that the project is free of vulnerabilities, errors, and that the project works as intended.
  
  Attention to detail is a skill that every software developer improves which not only improves the final output of the project but also improves the developersâ€™ coding skills. By using best practices with attention to detail, I can analyze my code and the code of my peers to look for mistakes and vulnerabilities that may have been overlooked during the development process. Coding reviews helps this process as the code can be looked at with a fresh mindset on what the purpose of the code is, what the developer is trying to achieve, and what the output is supposed to look like. Best practices come into play when coding to allow the code to be readable by other developers and not just yourself. This includes proper formatting of the code and commenting on the code to briefly describe a function or to comment changes made to the code during the code review.
  
  Since the start of my journey through the Computer Science program, I have learned the importance of the Software Development Life Cycle and how to apply SCRUM strategies to the projects. Either working on the projects by myself or working on the projects with a team, I have learned the process it takes to plan the project and what it takes to coordinate a development team through the Software Development Life Cycle to get the project to its desired output in the specified time frame that is available for the project. Understanding the needs of the client is a big part of the Software Development Life Cycle as it allows the developers to fill those needs in the project by using desired algorithms or designs. Taking the clients desired output and turning it into a reality is a success for both the client and the team developing the project.
  
  Throughout the Computer Science program, I have increased my ability to learn new skills in a timely manner. I learned how to create a fully functioning webpage using HTML and JavaScript within a short period of time and I can take this new knowledge with me to develop it further. The artifacts that are in this ePortfolio demonstrate how far I have come from the beginning of my journey at Southern New Hampshire University. Coming into the program with no coding or software development knowledge and coming out of the program with the knowledge to make full-stack, front-end, and back-end projects. These artifacts demonstrate my technology skills in software engineering, data structures and algorithms, databases, and security. The skills that I am coming out of the Computer Science program with show that I can create projects that can not only be understood by the computer but also can be understood by the developers that come across the projects.

  Description of Artifact One: The first artifact that I chose for my ePortfolio is a project that contains a rendering of a 3D model. This project is from CS330: Computational Graphics & Visualization. Written in Visual Studio Community using C++ OpenGL, this project was not fully completed when I finished this course. During the course I had difficulty adding more than one 3D rendering to the project and it was left incomplete but still showed the milestones for each category the project required me to show. I chose this artifact because it shows how far I have come with C++ OpenGL by adding more 3D renders to the project to show a complete table with objects on it instead of a table with one object on it.
  
  Enhancing this artifact shows that I can create fully functional 3D renderings by using nothing but code instead of using a pre-built program such as Blender. This artifact demonstrates the mathematical knowledge I have gained over my years as a student at SNHU by plotting the points to create a 3D model instead of a simple 2D model. This artifact also demonstrates my knowledge with the C++ OpenGL coding language and my knowledge of using the Visual Studio Community coding environment.
  
  During the enhancement process, I learned that planning out an idea for a project is the easiest part of coding and that the hard part is taking that idea and making it a reality. I learned how to add multiple 3D models to a single project and how to map these models on a 3D graph to align them the way I want them to show up in the render. The 3D models in this project were created using vertices of triangles. To make a Notebook, I had to map out the triangles correctly to align them together and create a rectangle for the face of the object. To turn this object into a 3D object, I then had to map the triangles to form the sides and bottom of the Notebook. This was done by graphing the points for the first triangle, flipping those points mathematically to connect the triangles together and then taking those points and adding a different depth to them to form the view of a 3D model. The same process was used when creating the Lamps base and neck. I ran into the challenge of flipping the points correctly to have the triangles render on the correct axis of the 3D graph to connect the triangles together and form the model. To fix this, I used graphing paper to create a 3D graph where I can plot each point and visualize my desired outcome before coding the points in the project itself. This helped me visualize my design and solve the graphing errors.
  
  This artifact was enhanced by adding two 3D models to fill the empty space of the table. This was done by coding in a Notebook and a Lamp that contains the lamps base and the lamps neck without having the objects overlapping. The objects that did overlap were the base and neck of the lamp to connect the rendered items together to form the Lamp as a whole.

  Description of Artifact Two: The second artifact that I chose for my ePortfolio is a project that contains a CRUD. This project is from CS340: Advanced Programming Concepts. Written in Jupyter Notebook using MongoDB, Python, and Pymongo. I chose this artifact to show my knowledge of using NoSQL databases and the Python coding language.

  This project uses a Python CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) file that connects to a Mongo Database and allows the specified data in the database to be sorted. This project showcases the file working with a set of data that is used to find and identify dogs for training in different fields to be able to find and help in the rescue of humans or other animals. The data is sorted into an interactive table that can be sorted by the training field of the service which will pull up the desired breeds for that field and the locations of the dogs who fit the criteria for that field. This project allows the search to be ran under specific parameters that the company requires as there are specific parameters that the dogs must fit to be able to go through the training such as being a specific breed or a specific age range. Using this project makes finding these animals easier as it lists out the animals that match the parameters in a data table that is interactive based on the training type.

  Enhancing this artifact shows the progress I have made with using Jupyter Notebook as a coding environment to create a full-stack web page that pulls data using a Python CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) file that I developed. The Python CRUD file allows the data uploaded to a Mongo Database to be sorted automatically based on certain parameters. This is done by importing the Python CRUD file into a desired project, altering the file to fit the MongoDB host requirements, and declaring the database that the file will be used with. I enhanced this artifact by correcting the radio buttons for the training services to be clickable and then I added some visual design changes to the text of the radio buttons to enlarge the text and change the color of the text to fit the colors of each training type. For example: the Water Rescue radio buttons text is enlarged and changed to blue to categorize the training as Water Rescue.

  Enhancements made to this artifact showcase that I can enhance algorithms search criteria and full-stack web functionality. I updated the Python CRUD file to include a Read All criteria that makes searching through the database easier as it allows all the files to be read. This project has a database of 10,000 files so the process takes a moment to load the query outcomes. I corrected the code for the radio buttons as there was a mistake in the spelling for Disaster Rescue or Individual Training that made the radio button unusable as the value that was being called was DIT and not DRIT. I then changed the pie chart visualization to include a title and to categorize the data by breed. I did run into the issue that my computer was running slow with Jupyter Notebook, and it kept timing out the outputs of the project which made checking the enhancements progress difficult. Without being able to see the output immediately after running the terminal, it made it difficult to make multiple changes at a time. To solve this issue, I broke the project into different cells where the main data was called on in the first few cells and the final cell printed the output. This did not solve the problem completely, but it allowed Jupyter Notebook to show the outputs faster which allowed me to see and correct any errors in a timely manner.

  Description of Artifact Three: The third artifact that I chose for my ePortfolio is the same as artifact two. This project is from CS340: Advanced Programming Concepts. Written in Jupyter Notebook using MongoDB, Python, and Pymongo. I chose this artifact to create a MongoDB interface with HTML/JavaScript by taking the partial HTML that is used in this project and turning it into a full web page. I used Visual Studio Code to create the web page using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. 

  While enhancing this project I quickly learned how different coding a web page with Jupyter Notebook and MongoDB is compared to coding a web page with HTML and JavaScript. Jupyter Notebook allowed me to incorporate the Mongo Database by importing the data internally and calling on the queries using the Python CRUD file. Doing this same process in Visual Studio Code was not successful as there are different ways to import the data to the web page. Starting on a blank coding project, I wrote the HTML code to create the outline of the web page that I desired. I have the Grazioso Salvare Logo centered at the top of the web page along with the title of the web page. I created a navigation bar to navigate to different pages on the site and originally this was going to be just for design, but I decided to make it fully functional by adding a Pie Charts page and an About page. The Pie Charts page contains the information about the different training categories and the desired breeds for each category along with the pie chart that shows how many desired breeds are in the database under the specified categories. The About page contains the information from the ReadMe file for the original project and a link to the GitHub repository that project sits in which allows the viewer to access the source code.

  One of the many challenges I faced in this project was importing a .CSV file that contained the data from the Mongo Database and calling on that data to fill an interactive table or pie chart using HTML or JavaScript. I learned how to import the .CSV file containing the data and how to create an HTML table based on the data. I added interactivity to the HTML table by changing the CSS design of the table to make the table look nice and added the function that the user can highlight parts of the table my hovering their mouse cursor over the table. The HTML table contains only 99 entries from the 10,000 entries that are in the Mongo Database to reduce loading time for the table. To make the HTML table a set size, I added the function that allows the table to scroll along the x-axis and the y-axis. This allows the table to show 10 files in the beginning and the user can scroll down further to reach file 99. I also learned how to make the navigation bar for each page interactive, where the user can hover their mouse cursor over a tab in the navigation bar and the tab will change color based on where the mouse cursor is hovering. I added the function that the active page the user is on will stay the highlighted color to show the user where they are on the web site. 

  This artifact showcases my knowledge in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. It demonstrates that I can take the information from a full-stack web site and use a different coding language to create a similar web site that contains the same data and a different layout.
